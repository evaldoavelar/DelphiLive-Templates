# DelphiLive-Templates
Skeleton code statement


Live Templates are reusable skeleton code statements. A set of Live Templates for Delphi and C++ are accessible in the Code Editor.

You can insert one of these pre-defined code skeletons into your code by double-clicking the template name in the Templates Window. You can also type the template name and press the Tab key to insert the template. The XML files for the RAD Studio Live Templates are located in C:\Program Files (x86)\Embarcadero\Studio\19.0\ObjRepos\en\Code_Templates.

You can add your own code templates to the Templates Window. The names of live templates can either represent the code in the template (such as class) or be the first word in the code (such as try), and some template names are close (but not exact) versions of words you might type (such as forr). Templates that you create (and templates provided by third party add-ins) are saved by default in the C:\Users\<user>\Documents\Embarcadero\Studio\code_templates directory.
